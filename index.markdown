# Hello.

## My name is Alonso.

I'm computer science student from Chile. Was a little burnout so suspended my studies and now been dedicating myself to things i'm interested in.

Currently working on a programming language, learning how to draw and learning how to blog.

Don't have a lot of things to show-off yet, but getting there.
